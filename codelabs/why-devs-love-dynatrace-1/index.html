<p>Dynatrace assist developers on creating <strong>better software faster</strong>. This series is crafted for developers and performance engineers on helping them get the feedback they need and analyze the impact of every code change on every release. We will also learn how automated and intelligent QualityGates and Performance as a Self-Service stop bad releases going into production automatically.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>This systematic and generic approach can be applied to any software that Dynatrace monitors and any CI/CD pipeline that our customers may use, meaning we can speed up üöÄ their delivery up to 80% while ensuring the functionality and a higher level of quality of their released software ‚úÖ.</p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="This" src="img/8c080a23b26abbe0.png"></p>
<p>Some of the topics you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help you become more comfortable using Dynatrace to diagnose application problems, understand the service dependencies, the architecture and know how and where to optimize.</li>
<li>Help you diagnose the overall health of an environment from thousands of services all the way to threads, exceptions and response times of a single transaction end-2-end through all layers (FullStack)</li>
<li>Get Feedback on Transactions for Developers</li>
<li>Do a Top Down-analysis and Bottom-Up (on single or multiple transactions)</li>
<li>Understand the added-value for developers to have an automated qualitygate in the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>Make the diagnosis easy for others in your organization</li>
<li>Not everybody needs to be a &#34;Dynatrace Expert&#34;</li>
<li>Understand how you can leverage Davis so she helps you monitor and diagnose applications.</li>
<li>Understand the value of automatic quality gates with performances as a self-service</li>
<li>Best Practices for automatic loadtesting and quality gates. How to build SLI/SLOs for continuous release comparison. </li>
<li>Integrate, compare and analyze Loadtests with Dynatrace</li>
<li>Compare and analyze GarbageCollection, Memory Allocation, Survived Objects, ThreadGroups &amp; blocking Threads as well as CPU Utilization for loadtests or any ondemand analysis for that matter.</li>

        <aside class="special"><p>As a developer you are asked to create high quality software faster. Fullstack Observability and automated distributed tracing with code level visibility give you all the data you need to analyse and understand response time hotspots, cpu and memory usage, errors and exceptions, service dependencies, synchronization and thread issues, inefficient database calls, problematic libraries or impact of 3rd party components.</p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="perfclinic_devslovedynatrace_ep1.gif" src="img/8021712f77742cec.gif"></p>
<p>In Episode 1 of this Performance Clinic Series, we will show you hands-on on how you can use Dynatrace in your development &amp; test environments to automate observability and analysis of your applications &amp; services. We will learn how to analyse problematic transactions in complex &amp; hybrid distributed systems. We will dive into easy access of your distributed traces (we call them PurePaths) and how Dynatrace automatically shows the hotspots so that you can easily optimize or fix them.</p>
<p>In Episode 1 we will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy start with Dynatrace in Development &amp; Integration environments</li>
<li>Analyze big &amp; complex environments</li>
<li>Enhance Developers FeedBack with distributed tracing and code level insights</li>
<li>Analyze and identify developer transactions (or any kind of transaction)</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Dev Feedback SignIn in Dynatrace" duration="0">
        <h3 is-upgraded>MDA FeedBack Developer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to MDA and search the request by <code>{RequestAttribute:Developer}</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/9706ebb42151f8d6.png"></p>
<p><em>You&#39;ll find your request for each transaction twice, but on an Apache Tomcat and on an NGINX. The NGINX (which is running in a docker container) works as a reverse proxa and forwards all headers, hence Tomcat also captures the </em><code>x-developer</code><em> header. pretty easy to understand by showing the service flow or backtrace.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Filter your SignIn requests and show the Service-Flow from the NGINX service.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/17f2f10983d512a2.png"></p>
<p>Remove the filter of the <code>sign</code> request. When removing the request type you&#39;ll notice the 3 distributed trace of your requests (2x signin + 1x login).</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Dynatrace is showing the average response time of the 3 requests and the intertiercalls to each service. The Response Time contribution is dependent of the selected transactions. By selecting a service (node) of the distributed transactions on the right you&#39;ll get an overview of the passing transactions and also the corresponding infrastructure, meaning if you have for example multiple replicasets of a deployment you can filter and see exactly which transactions passed through which container (process) inside a pod.</p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/13c1b9ce371b75f8.png"></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s filter the transaction of the correct Account creation. Add a <code>response code:200</code> and <code>request:sign</code></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/10cf2d9c367a8f6.png"></p>
<p>Now on the NGINX Service we click <strong>Analyze</strong> and go to the <strong>Response time hotspots</strong>. I like to think that I submerge into the service and navigate inside the service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/9ba9f06835d29e8e.png"></p>
<p>Inside the Response Time hotspots Dynatrace shows us the average time of the selected transactions on the NGINX service. The distribution of its transactions (we have only one here) and the top findings.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/39dd763c543b263f.png"></p>
<p>We see that the most of the time is spent on interaction with other services which is the Method <code>signUser</code> on the EasyTravel Service. We click on the filter to navigate forward.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/9f9bcfd30f5eed3a.png"></p>
<p>Notice how we <strong>jumped</strong> into the next service. Imagine that you are navigating within the distributed transactions and now you find yourself on the next service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/c85e596b7c49cee6.png"></p>
<p>Notice how we start adding a chain of filters into the analysis and we navigate through the services. Now the time changed to 13.9 ms because we are in the <strong>EasyTravelService.</strong> From those 13.9ms, 8 milliseconds are spent on code execution whitin this service (java code since its a tomcat) and 5.82 ms in calls to <code>addNewUser</code>in the <code>AuthenticationService</code>. We click on the filter on the <code>addNewUser</code>in the <code>AuthenticationService</code> to jump to the next service.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/c71ef4d943a7f649.png"></p>
<p>Now we find ourselves in the AuthenticationService. The timings adapt and we see the information for this transaction and this service. By clicking to the Database we see there were 8 request = 4 Connection Aquisitions + 2 SQL Statements (1 x Select + 1 x Insert ) + its corresponding 2 Commits.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/7f90db96cb86309f.png"></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s show the Purepath so we understand how we navigated. Scrolldown and click on Backtrace and on the NGINX node, click on <strong>Analyze &gt; Purepaths</strong>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/c36cb8b228bfcb5d.png"></p>
<p>Now it&#39;s showing us the purepath from the nginx as start (distributed trace with all it&#39;s spans and code insights). On the dropdown on the right, show the HTTP request data. Now we remove the filter of the <strong>response code 200</strong> on the NGINX node and click <strong>apply</strong>. What happens?</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/d08a1c5d94580015.png"></p>
<p>It&#39;s also showing us the transaction that failed.</p>
<p>If you compare them you&#39;ll notice that the one that succeded (besides having the response code 200 which is obvious) has an insert statement.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/e78c81555800be50.png"></p>
<p>This is due the fact that the previous select statement (select user...) does not find the account hence is able to insert a new account in the database.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/ad7c9f481646848a.png"></p>
<p>The subsequent account creation returns a row hence the double account can&#39;t be created.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/96da217a80308e2d.png"></p>
<p>The rows returned can also be seen for both transactions by displaying the purepaths from the database node.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="alt" src="img/82cf5142fad8f4a5.png"></p>

        <h3 is-upgraded>Service-flow Login</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now show the flow of your Login.</li>
<li>Notice again the intertier-calls how they add up, the contribution of each service and the infrastructure where it&#39;s running.</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>ResponseTime Hotspots Login</h3>
<p>Open the ResponseTime Hotspots from the ReverseProxy. Notice the contribution from Tomcat the Calls to AuthenticationService (4x) and VerificationService (1x)</p>
<p>Notice the contribution by Method within the AuthenticationService and how it can tell us which method is taking the most time within a single transaction (even though we are moving in 2 digit ms time)</p>
